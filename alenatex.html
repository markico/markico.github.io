                                            Teungku Daud Beureueh (1899 in Pidie, Aceh – 1987 in Jakarta), military Governor of Aceh (1945–1953) and leader of the Darul Islam rebellion in the province (1953–1963). Born in the Keumangan chiefdom of Pidië regency, he began from 1930 to champion a more modern form of Islamic school, and to become a popular reformist preacher. In 1939 he established and lead the Persatuan Ulama Seluruh Aceh (PUSA), or All Aceh Islamic Scholars Association. PUSA was not initially anti-Dutch, but emerged as the principal critic of the Dutch-supported hierarchy of uléëbalang (aristocrat-officials). Its members contacted the Japanese before their 1942 invasion, in the hope of overturning uléëbalang rule as a reward for their support. As the Japanese saw a greater need for popular support in 1944, they transferred many judicial functions from the uléëbalang to religious courts headed by Daud. After the Japanese surrender this conflict between religious and secular elites became violent, leading to the eclipse of the uléëbalang and the killing of many in December 1945. Daud was thereafter the most influential figure in Aceh, and his support for the Indonesian Republic's struggle against the returning Dutch helped make Aceh a bastion of the Republican cause. He was recognized as Military Governor in 1947, and Governor once independence was won in 1950. He and his supporters were alienated from Jakarta thereafter. Daud was sidelined in favor of western-educated leaders in 1951 when Aceh was merged in a larger Province of North Sumatra with a substantial Christian (Batak) minority. Supported by former PUSA members and much of the military, he led a rebellion against Jakarta in September 1953, declaring that Aceh would join the insurgent Negara Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic State) formed earlier in Java by Kartosuwirjo. Jakarta quickly retook the cities, but resistance was widespread until 1959, when many supporters accepted a peace agreement whereby Aceh would become a "Special Region" with the right to enact Islamic laws. Daud himself did not return from his guerrilla base until 1962, however, when he was given an amnesty but remained very critical. After the appearance of GAM separatists in 1977, Beureueh, who secretly supported the rebels, was arrested and held under house arrest in Jakarta until his death in 1987. 3.

                                            find the orientation, complication, and resolution in the text below.THE STORY of LUTUNG KASARUNGPrabu Tapa Agung was an old king. He had two daughters, Purbararang and Purbasari. Prabu Tapa Agung planned to retire as a king. Prabu Tapa Agung appoint Purbasari, her youngest daughter to replace him as a the leader of the kingdom."I'm too old, it's time I stepped off the throne," said Prabu Tapa.Purbasari has a sister named Purbararang. Hearing this, Purbararang was angry. He does not agree his sister was appointed to replace their father."You cannot ask her to be the queen, Father. I'm older than she is. It's supposed to be me, not her!" said Purbararang.But the king still chose Purbasari to be the next queen. Purbararang then set a bad plan with her fiance, Indrajaya. Together they went to a witch and asked her to put a spell on Purbasari. Later, suddenly Purbasari had bad skin. There were black dots all over her body. Purbararang make it an excuse to expel her sister."People who cursed like her does not deserve to be a Queen!" said Purbararang to her father.And then Purbararang go to meet her sister."You are not as beautiful as I am. You cannot be the queen. Instead, you have to leave this palace and stay in a jungle," said Purbararang.Then she sent a Patih (Governor) to alienate Purbasari into the forest. Purbasari was very sad.Arriving at the jungle, Patih (The Governor) is still kind enough to make a hut for Princess Purbasari. He also advised Purbasari, "Be brave Princess. The affliction will surely end, the Almighty will always be with Princess"."Thank you uncle," said Purbasari.Now she had to stay in the jungle. Over in the jungle he has many friends of animals that are always good to her. Every day she spent her time playing with some animals. Among these animals there was a mysterious black hairy monkey that always tried to cheer her up. It was not just an ordinary monkey, he had magical power. And he also could talk with humans. The monkey's name was Lutung Kasarung. The monkey is the most attention to Purbasari. Lutung Kasarung is always make happy Princess Purbasari to get the beautiful flowers and fruits with their friends.At the time of full moon night, Lutung Kasarung acting strange. He walked to a quiet place and meditated. He is obtaining something to the Gods. This proves that the Lutung Kasarung no ordinary creature. Not long later, near the monkey broke ground and created a small lake, the water was clear as a bell. The water contains ingredients that are very fragrant.The next day Lutung Kasarung meet Purbasari and asked her to bathe in the lake."What's in it for me?" thought Purbasari.But she was willing to oblige. Shortly, after he plunged herself into the river. Something happened to her skin. Her bad skin is cured and she becomes beautiful again. Purbasari was very surprised and very happy when she looked in the mirror in the lake.After that, she asked Lutung Kasarung to accompany her to go back to the palace. Purbararang was very shocked, she did not believe to see her sister get the beauty skin again. She knew she had to come up with another bad idea."Who is the longest hair she was the one who wins and will be the queen!" said Purbararang.Originally Purbasari not want to, but because Purbararang urged continued to serve her. The king then measured his daughters hair.

                                            The White ButterflyAn old man named Takahama lived in a little house behind the cemetery of the temple of Sozanji. He was extremely friendly and generally liked by his neighbours, though most of them considered him a little mad. That was because he was very old but he did not want to get married.He did not have the desire for intimate relationship with women.One summer day he became very ill, so ill, in fact, that he sent for his sister-in-law and her son. They both came and did all they could to bring comfort during his last hours. While Takahama fell asleep, they watched a large white butterfl y  flew into the room and rested on the old man’s pillow. The young man tried to drive it away with a fan; but it came back three times, as if it was very loath to leave the sufferer.At last Takahama’s nephew chased it out into the garden, through the gate, and into the cemetery beyond, where it lingered over a woman’s tomb, and then mysteriously disappeared. On examining the tomb the young man found the name “Akiko” written upon it, together with a description narrating how Akiko died when she was eighteen. Though the tomb was covered with moss and must have been erected fifty years previously, the boy saw that it was surrounded with fl owers, and that the little water tank had been recently filled.When the young man returned to the house he found that Takahama had passed away,and he returned to his mother and told her what he had seen in the cemetery.“Akiko?” murmured his mother. “When your uncle was young he was betrothed to Akiko.She died shortly before her wedding day. When Akiko left this world your uncle resolved never to marry, and to live ever near her grave. For all these years he has remained faithful to his vow, and kept in his heart all the sweet memories of his one and only love. Every day Takahama went to the cemetery, whether the air was fragrant with summer breeze or thick with falling snow. Every day he went to her grave and prayed for her happiness, swept the tomb and set  flowers there.When Takahama was dying, and he could no longer perform his loving task, Akiko came for him.That white butterfly was her sweet and loving soul.16.

                            5. Teungku Daud Beureueh (1899 in Pidie, Aceh – 1987 in Jakarta), military Governor of Aceh (1945–1953) and leader of the Darul Islam rebellion in the province (1953–1963). Born in the Keumangan chiefdom of Pidië regency, he began from 1930 to champion a more modern form of Islamic school, and to become a popular reformist preacher. In 1939 he established and lead the Persatuan Ulama Seluruh Aceh (PUSA), or All Aceh Islamic Scholars Association. PUSA was not initially anti-Dutch, but emerged as the principal critic of the Dutch-supported hierarchy of uléëbalang (aristocrat-officials). Its members contacted the Japanese before their 1942 invasion, in the hope of overturning uléëbalang rule as a reward for their support. As the Japanese saw a greater need for popular support in 1944, they transferred many judicial functions from the uléëbalang to religious courts headed by Daud. After the Japanese surrender this conflict between religious and secular elites became violent, leading to the eclipse of the uléëbalang and the killing of many in December 1945. Daud was thereafter the most influential figure in Aceh, and his support for the Indonesian Republic's struggle against the returning Dutch helped make Aceh a bastion of the Republican cause. He was recognized as Military Governor in 1947, and Governor once independence was won in 1950. He and his supporters were alienated from Jakarta thereafter. Daud was sidelined in favor of western-educated leaders in 1951 when Aceh was merged in a larger Province of North Sumatra with a substantial Christian (Batak) minority. Supported by former PUSA members and much of the military, he led a rebellion against Jakarta in September 1953, declaring that Aceh would join the insurgent Negara Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic State) formed earlier in Java by Kartosuwirjo. Jakarta quickly retook the cities, but resistance was widespread until 1959, when many supporters accepted a peace agreement whereby Aceh would become a "Special Region" with the right to enact Islamic laws. Daud himself did not return from his guerrilla base until 1962, however, when he was given an amnesty but remained very critical. After the appearance of GAM separatists in 1977, Beureueh, who secretly supported the rebels, was arrested and held under house arrest in Jakarta until his death in 1987. 3.

                            9. The White ButterflyAn old man named Takahama lived in a little house behind the cemetery of the temple of Sozanji. He was extremely friendly and generally liked by his neighbours, though most of them considered him a little mad. That was because he was very old but he did not want to get married.He did not have the desire for intimate relationship with women.One summer day he became very ill, so ill, in fact, that he sent for his sister-in-law and her son. They both came and did all they could to bring comfort during his last hours. While Takahama fell asleep, they watched a large white butterfl y  flew into the room and rested on the old man’s pillow. The young man tried to drive it away with a fan; but it came back three times, as if it was very loath to leave the sufferer.At last Takahama’s nephew chased it out into the garden, through the gate, and into the cemetery beyond, where it lingered over a woman’s tomb, and then mysteriously disappeared. On examining the tomb the young man found the name “Akiko” written upon it, together with a description narrating how Akiko died when she was eighteen. Though the tomb was covered with moss and must have been erected fifty years previously, the boy saw that it was surrounded with fl owers, and that the little water tank had been recently filled.When the young man returned to the house he found that Takahama had passed away,and he returned to his mother and told her what he had seen in the cemetery.“Akiko?” murmured his mother. “When your uncle was young he was betrothed to Akiko.She died shortly before her wedding day. When Akiko left this world your uncle resolved never to marry, and to live ever near her grave. For all these years he has remained faithful to his vow, and kept in his heart all the sweet memories of his one and only love. Every day Takahama went to the cemetery, whether the air was fragrant with summer breeze or thick with falling snow. Every day he went to her grave and prayed for her happiness, swept the tomb and set  flowers there.When Takahama was dying, and he could no longer perform his loving task, Akiko came for him.That white butterfly was her sweet and loving soul.16.
