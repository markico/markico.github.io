                                            Chinese IT company iFly Tek is developing an artificial intelligence robot that will take part in the country's college entrance exam in 2020, with the goal of beating 80 percent of the students in China, the company announced at a product launch in Beijing.
"It is easy for AI to pass an exam, because the machine has much stronger memory ability than humans. But to beat 80 percent of students - which means it can enroll at a key university in China - is difficult," said Liu Qingfeng, the company's CEO.
The national college entrance exam, also known as the gaokao, is one of the most highly competitive exams and has about 9 million participants across China every year.
"AI's participation in the gaokao is the best proof of its ability to learn and reason," Liu said.
The project is sponsored by Program 863, an initiative endorsed by then-leader Deng Xiaoping in 1986 to boost high-tech development.
"Performing well in the gaokao requires advanced technology in human-machine interaction, knowledge management and inference-learning, which are the key technologies we are committed to developing through this project," Liu said.
Now the AI device, known as iFly Hyperbrain, performs well in tests on politics and essay writing, showcasing its ability to think.
Currently Japan is developing an AI named Todai, which is scheduled to participate in Japan's National Center Test for University Admissions in 2016.
In September, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in the United States, also known as AI2, announced that it had created an AI system that can solve SAT college test geometry questions as well as the average 11th-grade student in the country - a breakthrough in AI research.
Between 2009 and 2013, some $17 billion was poured into the AI sector, which has seen 60 percent annual growth, according to a report published in 2014 by quantitative analysis firm Quid.
Hu Yu, senior deputy president of iFly Tek, said the fast development of AI in recent years is tied to the rise of neural network technology and big data.
"Most important, the Internet has changed the way we think. In the past, we tried to ensure that every detail was perfect before we transferred lab research into products. But now we put the AI online even though it still needs much improvement, and we complete the perfection process with feedback from tens of thousands of users," he said.
Based on current technology, the company has created two products: one to evaluate students' in-class performance so that teachers can assign different homework to students according to gaps of their knowledge; the other can score students' oral English competence, which has replaced teachers' scoring in the gaokao in Guangdong and Guangxi, as well as in a number of other key tests nationwide.

Most American families can afford to buy cotton candy these days, but it wasn't always that way. Cotton candy was first made in Europe during the 17th century, but making it back then took a lot of work and most people couldn't afford it. In 1897 William Morrison and John Wharton invented machine-spun cotton candy. This made cotton candy much cheaper to produce. People fell in love with the treat when Morrison and Wharton introduced it at the 1904 World's Fair. Morrison and Wharton called the treat "fairy floss," it was Joseph Lascaux who actually called the treat "cotton candy" in 1921. The next big breakthrough came in the 1970s, when a machine was invented that created the cotton candy and packaged it automatically. This made producing and distributing cotton candy cheaper and easier than ever. Now cotton candy can be found in carnivals, fairs, and circuses around the world. Aside from the delicious taste, the best part about today's cotton candy is its affordability.</a>

                                            Go ahead, have a cheeseburger, France's Constitutional Council said recently.The agency that monitors the constitutionality of laws wasn't ruling on nutrition but onlinguistics. Its decision substantially weakens a recent law meant to stop the invastion of foreignwords into the French language. That law banned the use of English in broadcasting, advertising,and science. The law would have, for instance, forced restaurateurs to advertise "hamburgers aufromage" instead of cheeseburgers.However, the Council ruled that the law encroached on the fundamental liberty ofthought and expression" guaranteed by the French constitution.111.

They can now serve hamburgers with cheese.B. They must now use only French words on menus.C. They may now use English words in advertisements.D. They no longer must serve only French foods.114. Why did the council make this decision about the law?A. Because so many people objected to the lawBecause the law was believed to violate the constitutionC. Because the restaurant owners were unhappy with the lawD. Because the law did not have its intended effect​</a>

                                            Recent technological advances in manned and unmanned undersea vehicles along with breakthrough in satellite technology and computer equipment have overcome some of the limitation of divers and diving equipment. Without a vehicle, divers often became sluggish and their mental concentration was limited. Because of undersea pressure that affected their speech organs, communication among divers was difficult of impossible. But today, most oceanographers make direct observations by mean of instrument that are lowered into the ocean, from samples taken from the water photograph made by orbiting satellites. Direct observations of the oceans floor are made not only by divers but also by deep-diving submarines and aerial photography. Some of the submarines can dive to depths of more than seven miles and cruise at depth of fifteen thousand feet. In addition, radio-equipped buoys can be operated by remote control in order to transit information back to land-based laboratories, often via satellite. Particularly important are data about water temperature, currents and weather. Satellite photograph can show the distributions of sea ice, oil slicks, and cloud formation over the ocean. Maps created from satellite pictures can represent the temperature and the color of the ocean’s surface, enabling researches to study the oceans currents. Furthermore, computers help oceanographers to collects and analyzed data from submarines and satellites. By creating a model of the ocean’s movements and characteristics, scientists can predict the patterns and possible effects of the oceans on the environments. Recently, many oceanographers have been living more on satellites and computers than on research ships or even submarine vehicles because they can supply a grater range of information problems, especially those concerning energy and food, may be solved with the help of observations made possible by this new technology.14.

                                            Transport issues have increasingly begun to attract political attention and it has been foreseen thatwithout a major transportation breakthrough, the city will have complete traffic gridlock by 2020. Weknow that Jakarta is the capital city of Indonesia, harboring 10 million inhabitants, out of 30 million livingin Greater Jakarta. It is estimated that over four million residents of the surrounding Greater Jakarta areacommute to and from the city each working day.Since 1980, more than 25 general and special subject studies have been conducted related topossible Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) systems in Jakarta. One of the major reasons for the delays intackling the problem was the economic and political crises of 1997-99. Before the crisis, a Build-Oper-ate-Transfer (BOT) scheme was considered as part of a new MRT calling for private sector involvement.After the crisis, the plan to rely on a BOT to provide financing proved unfeasible, and the MRT project wasagain proposed as a government-funded scheme.Currently, public transportation in Jakarta serves only 56% of commuter trips. This figure urgentlyneeds to be raised, as the city's 9.5% average annual growth rate of motorized vehicles far exceeds the0.01% increase in road length between 2005 and 2010. Public transportation now mainly consists ofTransJakarta bus rapid transit system, Jabodetabek Commuter Railway system, various types of buses,starting from the very small bemo and pickup-truck sized mikrolet, to slightly larger minibuses such asthe widely used Metro Mini and Kopaja minibuses and full sized city buses.1.

                        <p>Jawaban:</p><p>1. breakthrough dalam bisnis: Air Minum Aqua. </p><p>2. Technological dalam binis : handphone. </p><p>3. ordinary innovation dalam bisnis : semangka kotak. </p><p>Penjelasan:</p><p>1. Karena bagaimana mungkin menjual air minum dalam kemasan yang harganya lebih mahal daripada bensin. Hal ini dikarenakan suatu terobosan atau cara baru dalam hal apa pun yang awalnya tidak ada menjadi ada atau yang awalnya tidak baik menjadi lebih baik. Segelas air minum bisa diinovasikan dalam bentuk kemasan sehingga mudah untuk bawa kemana-mana.</p><p>2. Diklasifikasikan kedalam technological karena dulunya yang hanya menggunakan surat kini telah diganti dengan menggunakan teknologi canggih yang biasa kita kenal dengan handphone. Handphone diciptakan dengan fitur kecil yang bisa menggirimkan surat electrik dan mampu mengeluarkan suara. Sehingga memudahkan kita dalam mengirim surat dan bisa dibawa kemana-mana.</p><p>3. Dari yang biasa di inovasikan menjadi sesuatu yang menarik. Semangka kotak sebenarnya sama saja dengan semangka pada umumnya, hanya saja bentuknya yang sedikit aneh tapi sebenernya sih lebih cocok dikatakan unik yaitu berbentuk kotak. Di klasifikasikan kedalam ordinary ini karena, semangka adalah suatu hal yang biasa, namun di inovasikan sehingga bisa menarik banyak peminat.</p><br />

                            5. main idea and title dari paragraf ini
Most American families can afford to buy cotton candy these days, but it wasn't always that way. Cotton candy was first made in Europe during the 17th century, but making it back then took a lot of work and most people couldn't afford it. In 1897 William Morrison and John Wharton invented machine-spun cotton candy. This made cotton candy much cheaper to produce. People fell in love with the treat when Morrison and Wharton introduced it at the 1904 World's Fair. Morrison and Wharton called the treat "fairy floss," it was Joseph Lascaux who actually called the treat "cotton candy" in 1921. The next big breakthrough came in the 1970s, when a machine was invented that created the cotton candy and packaged it automatically. This made producing and distributing cotton candy cheaper and easier than ever. Now cotton candy can be found in carnivals, fairs, and circuses around the world. Aside from the delicious taste, the best part about today's cotton candy is its affordability.</h2><br />
                        Main idea: Most American families can afford to buy cotton candy these days, but it wasn't always that way (gagasan utama dari paragraf tersebut terletak di awal paragraf karena kalimat setelah gagasan utama dari paragraf yang Anda berikan merupakan penjabaran dari gagasan utama).

                            17. Recent technological advances in manned and unmanned undersea vehicles along with breakthrough in satellite technology and computer equipment have overcome some of the limitation of divers and diving equipment. Without a vehicle, divers often became sluggish and their mental concentration was limited. Because of undersea pressure that affected their speech organs, communication among divers was difficult of impossible. But today, most oceanographers make direct observations by mean of instrument that are lowered into the ocean, from samples taken from the water photograph made by orbiting satellites. Direct observations of the oceans floor are made not only by divers but also by deep-diving submarines and aerial photography. Some of the submarines can dive to depths of more than seven miles and cruise at depth of fifteen thousand feet. In addition, radio-equipped buoys can be operated by remote control in order to transit information back to land-based laboratories, often via satellite. Particularly important are data about water temperature, currents and weather. Satellite photograph can show the distributions of sea ice, oil slicks, and cloud formation over the ocean. Maps created from satellite pictures can represent the temperature and the color of the ocean’s surface, enabling researches to study the oceans currents. Furthermore, computers help oceanographers to collects and analyzed data from submarines and satellites. By creating a model of the ocean’s movements and characteristics, scientists can predict the patterns and possible effects of the oceans on the environments. Recently, many oceanographers have been living more on satellites and computers than on research ships or even submarine vehicles because they can supply a grater range of information problems, especially those concerning energy and food, may be solved with the help of observations made possible by this new technology.14.

As a scientist, he managed to find a way to prevent food spoilage until some time with the process of heating, commonly called pasteurization. Louis Pasteur started his career as a physicist at a high school. At the age of 26 he was a professor at the University of  Strasbourg, then he moved to the University of Lille and there in 1856 he made a huge discovery in the field of medicine. The initial discovery was pasteurization ie deadly bacteria in milk with heating.
        He married a daughter from the Rector’s university, Marie Laurent, on May 29, 1849 and was blessed with five children. Three of his 5 children died of typhoid fever. This is what gives him the motivation to himself in curing infectious diseases. His first work on molecular Asymmetry, Louis discusses the nature of tartaric acid.

                            25. Transport issues have increasingly begun to attract political attention and it has been foreseen thatwithout a major transportation breakthrough, the city will have complete traffic gridlock by 2020. Weknow that Jakarta is the capital city of Indonesia, harboring 10 million inhabitants, out of 30 million livingin Greater Jakarta. It is estimated that over four million residents of the surrounding Greater Jakarta areacommute to and from the city each working day.Since 1980, more than 25 general and special subject studies have been conducted related topossible Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) systems in Jakarta. One of the major reasons for the delays intackling the problem was the economic and political crises of 1997-99. Before the crisis, a Build-Oper-ate-Transfer (BOT) scheme was considered as part of a new MRT calling for private sector involvement.After the crisis, the plan to rely on a BOT to provide financing proved unfeasible, and the MRT project wasagain proposed as a government-funded scheme.Currently, public transportation in Jakarta serves only 56% of commuter trips. This figure urgentlyneeds to be raised, as the city's 9.5% average annual growth rate of motorized vehicles far exceeds the0.01% increase in road length between 2005 and 2010. Public transportation now mainly consists ofTransJakarta bus rapid transit system, Jabodetabek Commuter Railway system, various types of buses,starting from the very small bemo and pickup-truck sized mikrolet, to slightly larger minibuses such asthe widely used Metro Mini and Kopaja minibuses and full sized city buses.1.

                            28. Chinese IT company iFly Tek is developing an artificial intelligence robot that will take part in the country's college entrance exam in 2020, with the goal of beating 80 percent of the students in China, the company announced at a product launch in Beijing."It is easy for AI to pass an exam, because the machine has much stronger memory ability than humans. But to beat 80 percent of students - which means it can enroll at a key university in China - is difficult," said Liu Qingfeng, the company's CEO.The national college entrance exam, also known as the gaokao, is one of the most highly competitive exams and has about 9 million participants across China every year."AI's participation in the gaokao is the best proof of its ability to learn and reason," Liu said.The project is sponsored by Program 863, an initiative endorsed by then-leader Deng Xiaoping in 1986 to boost high-tech development."Performing well in the gaokao requires advanced technology in human-machine interaction, knowledge management and inference-learning, which are the key technologies we are committed to developing through this project," Liu said.Now the AI device, known as iFly Hyperbrain, performs well in tests on politics and essay writing, showcasing its ability to think.Currently Japan is developing an AI named Todai, which is scheduled to participate in Japan's National Center Test for University Admissions in 2016.In September, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence in the United States, also known as AI2, announced that it had created an AI system that can solve SAT college test geometry questions as well as the average 11th-grade student in the country - a breakthrough in AI research.Between 2009 and 2013, some $17 billion was poured into the AI sector, which has seen 60 percent annual growth, according to a report published in 2014 by quantitative analysis firm Quid.Hu Yu, senior deputy president of iFly Tek, said the fast development of AI in recent years is tied to the rise of neural network technology and big data."Most important, the Internet has changed the way we think. In the past, we tried to ensure that every detail was perfect before we transferred lab research into products. But now we put the AI online even though it still needs much improvement, and we complete the perfection process with feedback from tens of thousands of users," he said.Based on current technology, the company has created two products: one to evaluate students' in-class performance so that teachers can assign different homework to students according to gaps of their knowledge; the other can score students' oral English competence, which has replaced teachers' scoring in the gaokao in Guangdong and Guangxi, as well as in a number of other key tests nationwide.pertanyaanya *explain the generic structure of the text kak tlg yg tau jwb bntuin bsok kmpl soalnya tlong kk ​</h2><br />
