                                            Cut Nyak Dien lahir tahun 1848 di Kerajaan Aceh. Ia lahir dari garis keturunan yang menomor satukan agama dan garis keluarga bangsawan.Ayahnya bernama Teuku Nanta Setia, ibunya bernama Putri Uleebalang Lampagar. Suaminya bernama Ibrahim Lamnaga telah meninggal dunia dan dari pernikahannya ia memiliki seorang anak laki-laki, kemudian ia menika dengan Teuku Umar dan memiliki seorang anak bernama Cut Gambang. Cut Nyak Dien memperoleh pendidikan agama dan keahlian hidup dengan baik oleh orang tua dan gurunya. Dan dia mendapat pengajaran yang mumpuni dari guru ngajinya.Pada tanggal 26 Maret 1873 Belanda pertama kali melancarkan serangan ke Aceh. Belanda langsung membakar Masjid Baiturrahman. Cut Nyak Dien melihatnya dan tidak tinggal diam.Ia langsung membangkitkan rasa perjuangan rakyat Aceh. Pada saat itu, Kesultanan Aceh mampu memukul mundur penjajah Belanda. Namun berikutnya, Belanda melancarkan serangan kembali pada tahun 1874-1880. Penjajah Belanda berhasil menguasai Keraton Kesultanan Aceh tahun 1874.Karena hal itu membuat rakyat Aceh tidak memiliki tempat yang aman untuk ditinggali. Akhirnya mereka memilih mengungsikan ibu-ibu dan anak-anak, Cut Nyak Dien termasuk rombongan pengungsi. Sedangkan suaminya dan para lelaki lain berjuang bertempur melawan Belanda guna merebut wilayah VI mukim Kesultanan Aceh.Dalam pertempuran ini Ibrahim suami Cut Nyak Dien tewas pada tanggal 29 Juni 1975. Inilah titik dimana Cut Nyak Dien mengambil ikrar untuk tidak berhenti memperjuangkan Aceh dan menghancurkan Belanda.Ia menikah untuk kedua kali dengan Teuku Umar, mereka menikah tahun 1880. Pernikahan ini disambut baik oleh rakyat Aceh. Dari pernikahan tersebut, dikarunia seorang anak diberi nama Cut Gambang. Perjuangan berlanjut dengan taktik Gerilya. Langkah awal diambil Teuku Umar dengan mendekati Belanda dan membangun hubungan kuat antara keduanya, demi mendapat kepercayaan Belanda.Dan semuanya mencapai puncak ketika Teuku umar bersama 250 pasukannya "menyerahkan diri" kepada Belanda dan mengaku ingin bergabung dengan Belanda. Peristiwa ini dilakukan pada tanggal 30 September 1893.Belanda sangat setuju, dan Teuku Umar diberi gelar Teuku Umar Johan Pahlawan. Dan memberikan kekuasaan penuh kepada Teuku Umar unuk menjadi komandan pasukan Belanda. Strategi yang diambil Teuku Umar dan Cut Nyak Dien bukan tanpa pertentangan. Banyak rakyat Aceh mengira mereka telah mengkhianati Aceh. Namun sambil terus mempelajari taktik Belanda, Teuku Umar merencanakan untuk menggempur Aceh.Ketika rencanannya telah disetujui Belanda, Teuku Umar dan Cut Nyak Dien bersama dengan pasukan serta senjata lengkap dengan amunisinya pergi berangkat ke Aceh.Namun ternyata tidak pernah kembali ke Belanda. Pengkhianatan ini dikenal dengan Het Verraad van Teukoe Oemar atau pengkhianatan Teuku Umar.Belanda sangat marah, dan mereka melancarkan operasi besar-besaran untuk menangkap Teuku Umar dan Cut Nyak Dien. Sementara itu Belanda dipimpin oleh Jenderal Jakobus Ludovicius. Tetapi, Teuku Umar berhasil menghancurkan pasukan Belanda. Dan Jenderal Jakobus berhasil dibunuh.Belanda tetap mencari siasat untuk melumpuhkan kekuatan Aceh. Belanda membayar orang untuk memata-matai Teuku Umar. Maka diketahui bahwa Teuku Umar akan menyerang Belanda pada tanggal 11 Februari 1899.Karena rencananya sudah diketahui, Teuku Umar gugur dalam perang tersebut. Meskipun begitu, Cut Nyak Dien tetap tegar dan terus melancarkan serangan kepada Belanda.Dengan usianya tidak lagi muda, Ia tetap melancarkan serangan ke Belanda. Namun bagaimanapun pihak Belanda didukung dengan kekuatan yang lengkap. Dan pada akhirnya Cut Nyak Dien berhasil tertangkap oleh pihak belanda dengan menyerbu tempatnya di Beutong Le Sageu. Atas jasanya melawan Belanda, pemerintah Soekarno menganugerahinya Pahlawan Nasional Indonesia melalui SK Presiden RI No. 106 Tahun 1964 tepatnya tanggal 2 Mei 1964. Gelar pahlawan ini atas pengajuan Gubernur Aceh Ali Hasan.Belanda mengirim Cut Nyak Dien dan diasingkan ke Sumedang - Jawa Barat. Karena faktor usia, Cut Nyak Dien meninggal di Sumedang tanggal 6 November 1908. Namun pada tahun 1959 makamnya baru ditemukan.Di dalam tahanan Cut Nyak Dien dijuluki dengan nama "Ibu Perbu", karena diangap sebagai perempuan yang memiliki pemahaman agama yang mumpuni.tolong kak terjemahkan ke dalam bahasa Inggris...tapi tolong jangan translate...karna kurang benar...plisss kak...​</a>

In 1875, Cut Nyak Dhien and her baby, along with other mothers, were evacuated to a safer location while her husband Ibrahim Lamnga fought to reclaim VI mukim. Lamnga died in action on June 29, 1878. Hearing this, Cut Nyak Dhien was enraged and swore to destroy the Dutch.
Some time later, Teuku Umar proposed to marry her. Learning that Teuku Umar would allow her to fight, she accepted his proposal. They were married in 1880. This greatly boosted the morale of Aceh armies in their fight against Dutch. Teuku Umar and Cut Nyak Dhien had a daughter, Cut Gambang.
The war continued, and the Acehnese declared Holy War against the Dutch, and were engaged in guerrilla warfare. Undersupplied, Teuku Umar surrendered to the Dutch forces on September 30, 1893 along with 250 of his men. The Dutch army welcomed him and appointed him as a commander, giving him the title of Teuku Umar Johan Pahlawan. However, Teuku Umar secretly planned to betray the Dutch. Two years later Teuku Umar set out to assault Aceh, but he instead deserted with his troops taking with them heavy equipment, weapons, and ammunition, using these supplies to help the Acehnese. This is recorded in Dutch history as “Het verraad van Teukoe Oemar” (the treason of Teuku Umar).
The Dutch general Johannes Benedictus van Heutsz sent a spy to Aceh. Teuku Umar was killed during a battle when the Dutch launched a surprise attack on him in Meulaboh. When Cut Gambang cried over his death, Cut Nyak Dhien slapped her and then she hugged her and said: “As Acehnese women, we may not shed tears for those who have been martyred.”
After her husband died, Cut Nyak Dhien continued to resist the Dutch with her small army until its destruction in 1901, as the Dutch adapted their tactics to the situation in Aceh. Furthermore, Cut Nyak Dhien suffered from nearsightedness and arthritis as she got older. The number of her troops was also decreasing and they suffered from lack of supplies.
One of her troops, Pang Laot, told the Dutch the location of her headquarters in Beutong Le Sageu. The Dutch attacked, catching Dhien and her troops by surprise. Despite desperately fighting back, Dhien was captured. Her daughter, Cut Gambang, escaped and continued the resistance. Dhien was brought to Banda Aceh and her myopia and arthritis slowly healed, but in the end she was exiled to Sumedang, West Java because the Dutch were afraid she would mobilize the resistance of Aceh people. She died on 6 November 1908.

                            3. Cut Nyak Dien lahir tahun 1848 di Kerajaan Aceh. Ia lahir dari garis keturunan yang menomor satukan agama dan garis keluarga bangsawan.Ayahnya bernama Teuku Nanta Setia, ibunya bernama Putri Uleebalang Lampagar. Suaminya bernama Ibrahim Lamnaga telah meninggal dunia dan dari pernikahannya ia memiliki seorang anak laki-laki, kemudian ia menika dengan Teuku Umar dan memiliki seorang anak bernama Cut Gambang. Cut Nyak Dien memperoleh pendidikan agama dan keahlian hidup dengan baik oleh orang tua dan gurunya. Dan dia mendapat pengajaran yang mumpuni dari guru ngajinya.Pada tanggal 26 Maret 1873 Belanda pertama kali melancarkan serangan ke Aceh. Belanda langsung membakar Masjid Baiturrahman. Cut Nyak Dien melihatnya dan tidak tinggal diam.Ia langsung membangkitkan rasa perjuangan rakyat Aceh. Pada saat itu, Kesultanan Aceh mampu memukul mundur penjajah Belanda. Namun berikutnya, Belanda melancarkan serangan kembali pada tahun 1874-1880. Penjajah Belanda berhasil menguasai Keraton Kesultanan Aceh tahun 1874.Karena hal itu membuat rakyat Aceh tidak memiliki tempat yang aman untuk ditinggali. Akhirnya mereka memilih mengungsikan ibu-ibu dan anak-anak, Cut Nyak Dien termasuk rombongan pengungsi. Sedangkan suaminya dan para lelaki lain berjuang bertempur melawan Belanda guna merebut wilayah VI mukim Kesultanan Aceh.Dalam pertempuran ini Ibrahim suami Cut Nyak Dien tewas pada tanggal 29 Juni 1975. Inilah titik dimana Cut Nyak Dien mengambil ikrar untuk tidak berhenti memperjuangkan Aceh dan menghancurkan Belanda.Ia menikah untuk kedua kali dengan Teuku Umar, mereka menikah tahun 1880. Pernikahan ini disambut baik oleh rakyat Aceh. Dari pernikahan tersebut, dikarunia seorang anak diberi nama Cut Gambang. Perjuangan berlanjut dengan taktik Gerilya. Langkah awal diambil Teuku Umar dengan mendekati Belanda dan membangun hubungan kuat antara keduanya, demi mendapat kepercayaan Belanda.Dan semuanya mencapai puncak ketika Teuku umar bersama 250 pasukannya "menyerahkan diri" kepada Belanda dan mengaku ingin bergabung dengan Belanda. Peristiwa ini dilakukan pada tanggal 30 September 1893.Belanda sangat setuju, dan Teuku Umar diberi gelar Teuku Umar Johan Pahlawan. Dan memberikan kekuasaan penuh kepada Teuku Umar unuk menjadi komandan pasukan Belanda. Strategi yang diambil Teuku Umar dan Cut Nyak Dien bukan tanpa pertentangan. Banyak rakyat Aceh mengira mereka telah mengkhianati Aceh. Namun sambil terus mempelajari taktik Belanda, Teuku Umar merencanakan untuk menggempur Aceh.Ketika rencanannya telah disetujui Belanda, Teuku Umar dan Cut Nyak Dien bersama dengan pasukan serta senjata lengkap dengan amunisinya pergi berangkat ke Aceh.Namun ternyata tidak pernah kembali ke Belanda. Pengkhianatan ini dikenal dengan Het Verraad van Teukoe Oemar atau pengkhianatan Teuku Umar.Belanda sangat marah, dan mereka melancarkan operasi besar-besaran untuk menangkap Teuku Umar dan Cut Nyak Dien. Sementara itu Belanda dipimpin oleh Jenderal Jakobus Ludovicius. Tetapi, Teuku Umar berhasil menghancurkan pasukan Belanda. Dan Jenderal Jakobus berhasil dibunuh.Belanda tetap mencari siasat untuk melumpuhkan kekuatan Aceh. Belanda membayar orang untuk memata-matai Teuku Umar. Maka diketahui bahwa Teuku Umar akan menyerang Belanda pada tanggal 11 Februari 1899.Karena rencananya sudah diketahui, Teuku Umar gugur dalam perang tersebut. Meskipun begitu, Cut Nyak Dien tetap tegar dan terus melancarkan serangan kepada Belanda.Dengan usianya tidak lagi muda, Ia tetap melancarkan serangan ke Belanda. Namun bagaimanapun pihak Belanda didukung dengan kekuatan yang lengkap. Dan pada akhirnya Cut Nyak Dien berhasil tertangkap oleh pihak belanda dengan menyerbu tempatnya di Beutong Le Sageu. Atas jasanya melawan Belanda, pemerintah Soekarno menganugerahinya Pahlawan Nasional Indonesia melalui SK Presiden RI No. 106 Tahun 1964 tepatnya tanggal 2 Mei 1964. Gelar pahlawan ini atas pengajuan Gubernur Aceh Ali Hasan.Belanda mengirim Cut Nyak Dien dan diasingkan ke Sumedang - Jawa Barat. Karena faktor usia, Cut Nyak Dien meninggal di Sumedang tanggal 6 November 1908.
