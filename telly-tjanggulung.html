At the back of our house we have our garden where I play with my sister.My family has a car, a computer, a colour télly with DVD, a washing machine, dishwasher, and a cat. Mum and dad both have mobile phones and I am hoping to get one soon. The day starts at about 7 o'clock when Dad and mum get up. My sister and I usually watchtelly in our pyjamas (night clothes) until breakfast. We have breakfast at 8 o'clock.I like to eat Rice Krispies (cereal) and jam on toast. I also drink a glass of milk. My mumusually only has toast, a glass of orange juice and a cup of coffee. Dad likes to have a friedbreakfast consisting of baked beans, bacon, tomatoes,mushrooms, two eggs and a sausage.After breakfast, my sister and I, put on our school uniform. I wear grey trousers, a whiteshirt and a blue sweat shirt.My favourite subjects at school are science and history. My favourite topic in history islearning about the ancient Egyptians. I also enjoy PE lessons - we play football, netball, cricketand sometimes we go cross-country running.What about you?Write soon.Craigpertanyaannya adalah: 1. he studies grade : a. three     c. five b. four       d. six2. he is from :a.

                                            SASTRA INGGRIS KELAS 12TUGAS : REVIEW TEXT           DADDY AND IHe never smiled, I couldn’t remember the last time I heard him laugh, maybe I was 4 or 5, things changed when he came back from the army this one time. Maybe that’s what made him this way, all that gun shooting and war zones, it can suck the life out of anybody. But I’d seen other marines on telly, wearing their uniforms all high and noble beaming on screen as they received their medals for hard work. They were heroes… daddy was on telly too one time, that’s the picture I kept in my mind as he smiled at the camera. That’s the last time I saw him ever really smile.I always wondered what happened to him, it’s like he went to bed one day and woke up a different person. Most people avoided him, even mommy, so it was just him and I. They’d just ignore him like they didn’t know him. I was turning 7 this summer, daddy hadn’t bought me anything for my last birthday but I hoped that he’d remember this year and get me something. I understood though, he was a busy man and being a hero wasn’t easy. So I tried to make it as easy as it could be for him, I stayed out of trouble, I listened to him even when he just stared at me without saying a word….I could read his eyes. He’d be telling me to be a good girl, he did that sometimes, speak with his eyes.Mommy would look at daddy’s picture and cry sometimes, I didn’t understand why she wouldn’t just talk to him. I always wondered if they’d had a huge fight but even when people fight they forgive each other right. I said that to mommy once and she pulled me close and cried even more, so I thought best to keep my thoughts to myself, I didn’t want to upset her.She had to work long hours lately, daddy didn’t go to work as much no more, he was almost home every week, so she had to pay for most of the bills. I loved having daddy around but I wished he’d get another job and help mommy. I’d ask him when I got home.School used to be fun, but I didn’t have many friends anymore. My old friends said I was weird and they stopped talking to me when daddy came to pick me up from school. I guess they didn’t like him, at least I’d made a new friend, Miss Pecker. She would sit with me all through recess if I wanted and listen to me as I told her all about daddy. She was always writing stuff in her little book, then she’d give me some candy and we would be done for the day until tomorrow.Daddy came to pick me up again today. I was chasing him around the park and people were staring at us. Some lady came over to me and asked me who I was with, I pointed at daddy and she looked at me funny. She said I shouldn’t be out in the park alone, but I wasn’t alone, I was with daddy, she was ignoring his presence too just like everybody else. She took my hand and said she’d take me home, I screamed, I wasn’t leaving without my daddy.She tried to explain that I wasn’t safe but I was, she was the stranger not daddy. So I pulled away from her and ran towards daddy.I woke up a few minutes later, there were a lot of police cars and people looking horrified and sad. I think there might have been an accident or something, I’m not quite sure…there are too many people and I can’t see anything. I move closer I see a body and there’s a lot of blood. It’s sad, but then I hear daddy calling me, he’s smiling. I run towards him and give him a bear hug. Now people are ignoring both of us, but its ok….daddy’s smiling again...I couldn’t be happier…wish mommy was here though…we’ll come back for her next time, for now it’s just daddy and I…..

                            8. SASTRA INGGRIS KELAS 12TUGAS : REVIEW TEXT           DADDY AND IHe never smiled, I couldn’t remember the last time I heard him laugh, maybe I was 4 or 5, things changed when he came back from the army this one time. Maybe that’s what made him this way, all that gun shooting and war zones, it can suck the life out of anybody. But I’d seen other marines on telly, wearing their uniforms all high and noble beaming on screen as they received their medals for hard work. They were heroes… daddy was on telly too one time, that’s the picture I kept in my mind as he smiled at the camera. That’s the last time I saw him ever really smile.I always wondered what happened to him, it’s like he went to bed one day and woke up a different person. Most people avoided him, even mommy, so it was just him and I. They’d just ignore him like they didn’t know him. I was turning 7 this summer, daddy hadn’t bought me anything for my last birthday but I hoped that he’d remember this year and get me something. I understood though, he was a busy man and being a hero wasn’t easy. So I tried to make it as easy as it could be for him, I stayed out of trouble, I listened to him even when he just stared at me without saying a word….I could read his eyes. He’d be telling me to be a good girl, he did that sometimes, speak with his eyes.Mommy would look at daddy’s picture and cry sometimes, I didn’t understand why she wouldn’t just talk to him. I always wondered if they’d had a huge fight but even when people fight they forgive each other right. I said that to mommy once and she pulled me close and cried even more, so I thought best to keep my thoughts to myself, I didn’t want to upset her.She had to work long hours lately, daddy didn’t go to work as much no more, he was almost home every week, so she had to pay for most of the bills. I loved having daddy around but I wished he’d get another job and help mommy. I’d ask him when I got home.School used to be fun, but I didn’t have many friends anymore. My old friends said I was weird and they stopped talking to me when daddy came to pick me up from school. I guess they didn’t like him, at least I’d made a new friend, Miss Pecker. She would sit with me all through recess if I wanted and listen to me as I told her all about daddy. She was always writing stuff in her little book, then she’d give me some candy and we would be done for the day until tomorrow.Daddy came to pick me up again today. I was chasing him around the park and people were staring at us. Some lady came over to me and asked me who I was with, I pointed at daddy and she looked at me funny. She said I shouldn’t be out in the park alone, but I wasn’t alone, I was with daddy, she was ignoring his presence too just like everybody else. She took my hand and said she’d take me home, I screamed, I wasn’t leaving without my daddy.She tried to explain that I wasn’t safe but I was, she was the stranger not daddy. So I pulled away from her and ran towards daddy.I woke up a few minutes later, there were a lot of police cars and people looking horrified and sad. I think there might have been an accident or something, I’m not quite sure…there are too many people and I can’t see anything. I move closer I see a body and there’s a lot of blood. It’s sad, but then I hear daddy calling me, he’s smiling. I run towards him and give him a bear hug. Now people are ignoring both of us, but its ok….daddy’s smiling again...I couldn’t be happier…wish mommy was here though…we’ll come back for her next time, for now it’s just daddy and I…..

But, as I read the first sentence, I fastly change my mind. There are nothing happy about this story at all.</p><p></p><p>I just wondered, why her dad never smiled? Why he just ignored people and was being ignored? I was confuse. Everything feels very sad. The fact that her mother never talked to her dad, but still always looking at her husband photos lovingly, seriously didn't get what the problem was.</p><p></p><p>Even when the girl at school. Her friends were ignoring her. And the most strange thing was the fact that her dad always picked her up from school and when someone wished to take her with or to saved her, this people seem like didn't noticed her dad at all. At this point, I was starting having this thought in my head that "Her Dad was dead already" He was dead! Like this little girl only saw his ghost. What she saw all this time was her dad's ghost!</p><p></p><p>It was confirmed on the last paragraph when there are a lot people around, blood every where and then her Dad start to smile again. They hugged each other and she couldn't see her Mother. That was because this girl was already dead as well. She was in thr same place with her Dad as a ghost that's why her Dad could smile again.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Penjelasan:</strong></p><p></p><p>Mapel: Bahasa Inggris</p><p></p><p>PS: Ceritanya creepy seriusan, tapi bikin penasaran.

Hi, how are you?My name is Craig and I'm ten years old.I am English because I was born in England, but I am also British because England is part of great Britain and is in the UK.

At the back of our house we have our garden where I play with my sister.My family has a car, a computer, a colour télly with DVD, a washing machine, dishwasher, and a cat. Mum and dad both have mobile phones and I am hoping to get one soon. The day starts at about 7 o'clock when Dad and mum get up. My sister and I usually watchtelly in our pyjamas (night clothes) until breakfast. We have breakfast at 8 o'clock.I like to eat Rice Krispies (cereal) and jam on toast. I also drink a glass of milk. My mumusually only has toast, a glass of orange juice and a cup of coffee. Dad likes to have a friedbreakfast consisting of baked beans, bacon, tomatoes,mushrooms, two eggs and a sausage.After breakfast, my sister and I, put on our school uniform. I wear grey trousers, a whiteshirt and a blue sweat shirt.My favourite subjects at school are science and history. My favourite topic in history islearning about the ancient Egyptians.

                            15. b. Read the following letter, then choose the correct answer correctly! Hi, how are you? My name is Craig and I'm ten years old. I am English because I was born in England, but I am also British because England is part of Great Britain and is in the UK. I live in a typical English family. I have a father, mother and a sister and we all live together in our house in a town in the south east corner of England. At the back of our house we have our garden where I play with my sister. My family has a car, a computer, a colour telly with DVD, a washing machine, dishwasher, and a cat. Mum and dad both have mobile phones and I am hoping to get one soon. The day starts at about 7 o'clock when Dad and mum get up. My sister and I usually watch telly in our pyjamas (night clothes) until breakfast. We have breakfast at 8 o'clock. . I like to eat Rice Krispies (cereal) and jam on toast. I also drink a glass of milk. My mum usually only has toast, a glass of orange juice and a cup of coffee. Dad likes to have a fried breakfast consisting of baked beans, bacon, tomatoes, mushrooms, two eggs and a sausage. After breakfast, my sister and I, put on our school uniform. I wear grey trousers, a white shirt and a blue sweat shirt. My favourite subjects at school are science and history. My favourite topic in history is learning about the ancient Egyptians. I also enjoy PE lessons - we play football, netball, cricket and sometimes we go cross-country running. What about you? Write soon. Craig He studies grade: a three c. five​</h2><br />
