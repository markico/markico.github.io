                                            Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess; but she would have to be a real princess. He travelled all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones. There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess.
One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.
It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.
Well, we'll soon find that out, thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.
On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.
"Oh, very badly!" said she. "I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It's horrible!"
Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.
Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.
So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no one has stolen it.
There, that is a true story.
1. How many people are involved in the story ?
2. What did the prince want ?
3. What made the real princess come yo the palace ?
4. Who opened the gate for the princess ?
5. Where did the princess sleep ?</a>

Livestock and poultry farms generate manure, bedding, milk-house wash water, spilled feed and dead animals that, if not properly managed, can impact water quality. Animal manure and related by products contain elements that, under certain circumstances, might reach surface or ground water and cause pollution. The location of an animal operation plays a role in how pollutants may reach water and the magnitude of environmental damage. Animal production in grain deficient regions may generate manure nitrogen or manure phosphorus in excess of the assimilative ability of nearby land for manure application. Air quality issues associated with confined animal operations are traditionally nuisance concerns, such as odors, but there is increasing focus on possible links between dust and other particulates, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide from animal operations and human health.

                                            The Princess and the PeaOnce upon a time, there was a prince who wanted to marrya princess; but she would have to be a real princess. He travelledall over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what hewanted. There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to findout whether they were real ones. There was always something aboutthem that was not as it should be. So he came home again and wassad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess.One evening, a terrible storm came on; there was thunder andlightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking Source: Princess-and-pea21was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! What asight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair andclothes; it ran down to the top of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she saidthat she was a real princess."Well, we'll soon find that out,” thought the old queen. However, she said nothingand went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on thebottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses. This was where the princess had to lie all night. In themorning she was asked how she had slept."Oh, very badly!” she said. “I have hardly closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knowswhat was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue allover my body. It's horrible!"Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right throughthe twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that. So the prince took her to behis wife, for now he knew that he had a real princess; and the pea was put in the museum,where it may still be seen, if no one has stolen it.Pesan moral apakah yg didapat dari cerita tersebut?​</a>

We wanted to get a new experience of living outdoor.We  had different task to do for camping. Mila, Aira, Zakia, Aisyah and I were in the second group. Aira had to take the tents, Mira was responsible to take the cooking utensils, Zakia never forgot to bring her guitar and camera and Aisyah had prepare the meals. But everyone should bring their own bedding, clothes and set of eating utensils. The bedding should be light and give enough protection against the damp ground.The first activity was to set up the tents while the others prepared for cooking the food. We did these activities about two hours before,having our meals.At night we had a camp fire. We sat around it, sang songs accompanied with guitars, played roles, danced, jokes and had some funny games. We were really happy.41.	What is the main idea of the second paragraph?​</a>

The Princess and the Pea
Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to find a princess, but she would have to be a real princess. So he traveled all around the world to find one, but there was always something wrong. There were princesses enough, but he could never be sure that they were real ones. There was always something about them that was not quite right. So he came home again and was sad, for he so much wanted to have a real princess.
One evening there was a terrible storm. It thundered and lightninged! The rain poured down! It was horrible! Then there was a knock at the city gate, and the old king went out to open it.
A princess was standing outside. But my goodness, how she looked from the rain and the weather! Water ran down from her hair and her clothes. It ran into the toes of her shoes and out at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.
"Well, we shall soon find that out," thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bedroom, took off all the bedding and laid a pea on the bottom of the bed. Then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty featherbeds of eiderdown on top of the mattresses.
That was where the princess was to sleep for the night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.
"Oh, horribly!" she said. "I hardly closed my eyes all night. Goodness knows what there was in the bed! I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It is horrible!"
Now they could see that she was a real princess, because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty featherbeds. Nobody but a real princess could be that sensitive.
So the prince took her for his wife, because now he knew that he had a real princess. And the pea was put in the art gallery where it can still be seen, unless someone has taken it.
Now see, that was a real story!</a>

There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess.
One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.
It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.
Well, we'll soon find that out, thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.
On this the princess had to lie all night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.
"Oh, very badly!" said she. "I have scarcely closed my eyes all night. Heaven only knows what was in the bed, but I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It's horrible!"
Now they knew that she was a real princess because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty eider-down beds.
Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.
So the prince took her for his wife, for now he knew that he had a real princess; and the pea was put in the museum, where it may still be seen, if no one has stolen it.
There, that is a true story.

Alkisah ada seorang pangeran yang ingin menikah dengan seorang putri; tapi dia harus menjadi seorang putri sejati. Dia berkeliling dunia untuk menemukannya, tetapi dia tidak bisa mendapatkan apa yang dia inginkan. Ada cukup banyak putri, tetapi sulit untuk mengetahui apakah mereka benar-benar putri. Selalu ada sesuatu tentang mereka yang tidak semestinya. Jadi dia pulang lagi dan sedih, karena dia sangat ingin memiliki seorang putri sejati. Suatu malam badai yang mengerikan datang; ada guntur dan kilat, dan hujan turun deras. Tiba-tiba terdengar ketukan di gerbang kota, dan raja tua itu pergi untuk membukanya. Itu adalah seorang putri yang berdiri di luar sana di depan gerbang. Tapi, baguslah! betapa indahnya pemandangan hujan dan angin yang membuatnya tampak. Air mengalir dari rambut dan pakaiannya; itu mengalir ke ujung sepatu dan keluar lagi di tumit. Namun dia mengatakan bahwa dia adalah seorang putri sejati. Baiklah, kita akan segera mengetahuinya, pikir ratu tua. Tetapi dia tidak berkata apa-apa, pergi ke kamar tidur, mengambil semua tempat tidur dari tempat tidur, dan meletakkan kacang di bagian bawah; kemudian dia mengambil dua puluh kasur dan meletakkannya di atas kacang polong, dan kemudian dua puluh kasur eider-down di atas kasur. Atas hal ini sang putri harus berbaring sepanjang malam. Di pagi hari dia ditanya bagaimana dia tidur. "Oh, sangat buruk!" kata dia. "Aku hampir tidak memejamkan mata sepanjang malam. Surga hanya tahu apa yang ada di ranjang, tapi aku berbaring di atas sesuatu yang keras, sehingga seluruh tubuhku hitam dan biru. Mengerikan!" Sekarang mereka tahu bahwa dia adalah putri sejati karena dia telah merasakan kacang polong melalui dua puluh kasur dan dua puluh tempat tidur eider-down. Tak seorang pun kecuali seorang putri sejati yang bisa sesensitif itu. Maka sang pangeran mengambilnya untuk istrinya, karena sekarang dia tahu bahwa dia memiliki seorang putri sejati; dan kacang polong itu ditaruh di museum, di mana ia masih bisa dilihat, jika tidak ada yang mencurinya.</p><br />

   Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to marry a princess; but she would have to be a real princess. He travelled all over the world to find one, but nowhere could he get what he wanted. There were princesses enough, but it was difficult to find out whether they were real ones. There was always something about them that was not as it should be. So he came home again and was sad, for he would have liked very much to have a real princess.
One evening a terrible storm came on; there was thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in torrents. Suddenly a knocking was heard at the city gate, and the old king went to open it.
It was a princess standing out there in front of the gate. But, good gracious! what a sight the rain and the wind had made her look. The water ran down from her hair and clothes; it ran down into the toes of her shoes and out again at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.
Well, we'll soon find that out, thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bed-room, took all the bedding off the bedstead, and laid a pea on the bottom; then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty eider-down beds on top of the mattresses.

Nobody but a real princess could be as sensitive as that.

The Princess and the Pea
Once upon a time there was a prince who wanted to find a princess, but she would have to be a real princess. So he traveled all around the world to find one, but there was always something wrong. There were princesses enough, but he could never be sure that they were real ones. There was always something about them that was not quite right. So he came home again and was sad, for he so much wanted to have a real princess.
One evening there was a terrible storm. It thundered and lightninged! The rain poured down! It was horrible! Then there was a knock at the city gate, and the old king went out to open it.
A princess was standing outside. But my goodness, how she looked from the rain and the weather! Water ran down from her hair and her clothes. It ran into the toes of her shoes and out at the heels. And yet she said that she was a real princess.
"Well, we shall soon find that out," thought the old queen. But she said nothing, went into the bedroom, took off all the bedding and laid a pea on the bottom of the bed. Then she took twenty mattresses and laid them on the pea, and then twenty featherbeds of eiderdown on top of the mattresses.
That was where the princess was to sleep for the night. In the morning she was asked how she had slept.
"Oh, horribly!" she said. "I hardly closed my eyes all night. Goodness knows what there was in the bed! I was lying on something hard, so that I am black and blue all over my body. It is horrible!"
Now they could see that she was a real princess, because she had felt the pea right through the twenty mattresses and the twenty featherbeds. Nobody but a real princess could be that sensitive.
So the prince took her for his wife, because now he knew that he had a real princess. And the pea was put in the art gallery where it can still be seen, unless someone has taken it.
Now see, that was a real story!</h2><br />
