                                            1. It has been noted that, traditionally, courts have granted divorces on fault grounds: one spouse is deemed to be at fault in causing the divorce. More and more today, however, divorces are being granted on a no-fault basis. Proponents of no-fault divorces argue that when a marriage fails, it is rarely the case that one marriage partner is completely to blame and the other blameless. A failed marriage is much more often the result of mistakes by both partners. Another argument in favor of no-fault divorce is that proving fault in court, in a public arena, is a destructive process that only serves to lengthen the divorce process and that dramatically increases the negative feelings present in a divorce. If a couple can reach a decision to divorce without first deciding which partner is to blame, the divorce settlement can be negotiated more easily and equitably and the post - divorce healing process can begin more rapidly.

Fog differs from clouds in that fog touches the surface of the Earth, while clouds do not.Of the two types of fog, advection fog occurs along the ocean coast or near rivers and lakes. This type of fast-moving fog, which may cover vast areas, occurs when the temperature of the wind blowing over a body of water differs from the temperature of the body of water itself. This kind of fog can occur when warm air moves over a cold surface of water; this commonly occurs along the ocean coastline or along the shores of large lakes. Advection fog can also occur when cooler air moves over the surface of warmer water; this is very common in the winter in an area such as Florida, where the temperature of the lakes is quite warm in relation to the temperature of the air.Radiation fog, quite different from advection fog, is immobile, cloudlike moisture generally found hovering over wintertime valleys. It occurs on clear nights when the Earth’s warmth escapes into the upper atmosphere; the ground gives off heat through radiation. As the land becomes cooler, the air above it also becomes cooler. This cooler air is unable to hold as much water vapor as it had when it was warmer; in this manner fog is created.According to the passage, fog is formed when wetness in the air is …a. Dampenedb.

It has been noted that, traditionally, courts have granted divorces on faults grounds: one
spouse is deemed to be at fault in causing the divorce. More and more today, however, divorces
are being granted on a no-fault basis.
Proponents of no-fault divorce argue that when a marriage fails, it is rarely the case that
one marriage partner is completely to blame and the other blameless. A failed marriage is much
more often the result of mistakes by both partners.
Another argument in favor of no-fault divorce is that proving fault in court, in a public arena,
is a destructive process thatt only serves to lengthen the divorce process and that dramatically
increases the negative feelings present in a divorce. If a couple can reach a decision to divorce
without first deciding which partner is to blame, the divorce settlement can be negotiated more
easily and equitably and the postdivorce healing process can begin more rapidly.

It has been noted that, traditionally, courts have granted divorces on fault grounds: one spouse is deemed to be at fault in causing the divorce. More and more today, however, divorces are being granted on a no-fault basis.
Proponents of no-fault divorces argue that when a marriage fails, it is rarely the case that one marriage partner is completely to blame and the other blameless. A failed marriage is much more often the result of mistakes by both partners.
Another argument in favor of no-fault divorce is that proving fault in court, in a public arena, is a destructive process that only serves to lengthen the divorce process and that dramatically increases the negative feelings present in a divorce. If a couple can reach a decision to divorce without first deciding which partner is to blame, the divorce settlement can be negotiated more easily and equitably and the postdivorce healing process can begin more rapidly.

                            1. how did J.K rowling divorce?</h2><br />
                        J.K. Rowling is the creator of the 'Harry Potter' fantasy series, one of the most popular book and film franchises in history.<br />Who Is J.K. Rowling?<br />Joanne Rowling (born July 31, 1965), who goes by the pen name J.K. Rowling, is a British author and screenwriter best known for her seven-book Harry Potter children's book series. J.K. Rowling was living in Edinburgh, Scotland, and struggling to get by as a single mom before her first book, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, was published. The children's fantasy novel became an international hit and Rowling became an international literary sensation in 1999 when the first three installments of Harry Potter took over the top three slots of The New York Times best-seller list after achieving similar success in her native United Kingdom. The series has sold more than 450 million copies and was adapted into a blockbuster film franchise. Rowling published the novel The Casual Vacancy in 2012, followed by the crime novel Cuckoo Calling under the pen name Robert Galbraith in 2013. In 2016, she released a play, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , and a movie, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.<br />J.K. Rowling’s Net Worth<br />According to The Sunday Times 2017 Rich List, J.K. Rowling’s net worth is £650 million (about $850 million) — making her wealthier than even<br />Queen Elizabeth II . Forbes put her wealth at $650 million in 2017, in large part due to the 450 million copies of Harry Potter sold to-date and the subsequent movie franchise that has grossed $7.7 billion. (Her worth would've been more in Forbes if it were not for the $150 million she has donated to various charities.) In the first half of 2017, Rowling took home an estimated $95 million thanks to her new play,<br />Harry Potter and the Cursed Child , and movie,<br />Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.<br />J.K. Rowlings Books<br />J.K. Rowling’s New Book<br />In July 2017, J.K. Rowling announced on her website that she would publish two new books for an exhibition at the British Library that celebrates the 20th anniversary of the publication of her first novel, Harry Potter and the Philosopher’s Stone . The books, Harry Potter: A History of Magic (described as the adult version) and Harry Potter: A Journey Through a History of Magic (the kid-friendly version), were released on October 20th and feature manuscripts, original illustrations and an exploration of the Harry Potter characters and magic.<br />'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone'<br />After a number of rejections, J.K. Rowling finally sold her first book for the equivalent of about $4,000. (The word "Philosopher" in the book’s original title was changed to "Sorcerer" for its publication in America.) The book, which first hit shelves in June 1997, was the start of a seven-book series chronicling the life of the young wizard Harry Potter and his motley band of cohorts at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.<br />'Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'<br />The second book in the Harry Potter series came out in July 1998.<br />'Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'<br />

Fog differs from clouds in that fog touches the surface of the Earth, while clouds do not.Of the two types of fog, advection fog occurs along the ocean coast or near rivers and lakes. This type of fast-moving fog, which may cover vast areas, occurs when the temperature of the wind blowing over a body of water differs from the temperature of the body of water itself. This kind of fog can occur when warm air moves over a cold surface of water; this commonly occurs along the ocean coastline or along the shores of large lakes. Advection fog can also occur when cooler air moves over the surface of warmer water; this is very common in the winter in an area such as Florida, where the temperature of the lakes is quite warm in relation to the temperature of the air.Radiation fog, quite different from advection fog, is immobile, cloudlike moisture generally found hovering over wintertime valleys. It occurs on clear nights when the Earth’s warmth escapes into the upper atmosphere; the ground gives off heat through radiation. As the land becomes cooler, the air above it also becomes cooler. This cooler air is unable to hold as much water vapor as it had when it was warmer; in this manner fog is created.According to the passage, fog is formed when wetness in the air is …a. Dampenedb. Heatedc. Castd. Vaporizede. Cooled4. the formulation of economic policies necessities meticulous consideration … large segments of the population.a. Affect them becauseb. Because of affectingc.

We had Mr Jones <strong>driven</strong> to the airport.</p><p>ーーーーーーーーーーーー</p>Explication<p><strong>Passive voice</strong> adalah salah satu dari dua  grammatical voice yang ada dalam tata bahasa Inggris.</p><p></p><p><strong>Passive voice</strong> menekankan pada <strong>penerima aksi</strong>, bukan pelaku aksi seperti dalam active voice. Jadi, <strong>subyek dalam kalimat pasif adalah patient/recipient</strong>, bukan agent.</p><p></p><p>Perhatikan dua kalimat ini:</p><p><strong>Active</strong>: John kicked the ball.  </p><p><strong>Passive</strong>: The ball was kicked by John.  </p><p></p><strong>John</strong> ⇉<strong>agent</strong>; pelaku aksi<strong>kick</strong><strong>(</strong><strong>ed</strong><strong>)</strong> ⇉ <strong>aksi</strong>; yang dilakukan agent<strong>the ball</strong> ⇉<strong>patient</strong>; penerima aksi<p></p><p>Aksi/kata kerja dalam kalimat pasif berpola <strong>be</strong> <strong>+ </strong><strong>past participle</strong>. Bentuk <strong>be</strong> disesuaikan dengan <strong>tense</strong> kalimat.</p><p></p><p>*Kalimat no 1 adalah kalimat yang menggunakan <strong>ditransitive verb</strong> atau kata kerja yang mempunyai dua obyek. Kedua obyek tersebut masing-masing berperan sebagai <strong>recipient</strong> (obyek tak langsung) dan <strong>patient</strong> (obyek langsung). Oleh sebab itu kalimat #1 mempunyai dua kalimat pasif.</p><p></p><p><strong>Causative</strong> adalah struktur kalimat yang digunakan ketika subyek kalimat bukanlah yang melakukan aksi tapi yang <strong>menyebabkan</strong> orang/sesuatu yang lain melakukan aksi.</p><p></p><p>Contoh:</p>I made a cake ∽ Saya membuat kue (<strong>bukan causative</strong>).I made <strong>my mum</strong> make a cake ∽ Saya membuat ibu membuatkan kue (<strong>causative</strong>).<p></p><p><strong>Causative structure</strong> ditandai dengan adanya <strong>causative verb</strong> yang antara lain adalah:</p><strong>let</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>make</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>have</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><strong>get</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><p></p><p><strong>Active causative</strong> adalah kalimat <strong>causative</strong>  yang ditandai adanya subyek kedua yang merupakan pelaku aksi.</p><p></p><p>Konstruksi <strong>active causative</strong>:</p>S₁ + <strong>let/make/have</strong> + S₂ (agent) + <strong>infinitive</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>S₁ + <strong>get</strong> + S₂ + <strong>to infinitive</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><p></p><p>Contoh:</p>I <strong>have</strong> the hairdresser <strong>cut</strong> my hair.  I <strong>get</strong> the hairdresser <strong>to cut</strong> my hair.  <p></p><p><strong>Passive causative</strong> adalah kalimat <strong>causative</strong> di mana subyek kedua merupakan penerima aksi.</p><p></p><p>Konstruksi <strong>passive causative</strong>:</p>S₁ + <strong>let/make/have/get</strong> + S₂ (patient) + <strong>past participle</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong><p></p><p>Contoh:</p>I <strong>have</strong> my hair <strong>cut</strong> (by the hairdresser).She <strong>got</strong> her room <strong>cleaned</strong> (by the maid).<p>ーーーーーーーーーーーー</p>Pelajari lebih lanjut:<p><strong>Passive Voice</strong></p>https://brainly.co.id/tugas/22444026https://brainly.co.id/tugas/37316963https://brainly.co.id/tugas/23245726<p><strong>Causative</strong></p>https://brainly.co.id/tugas/23176863https://brainly.co.id/tugas/21082930https://brainly.co.id/tugas/23147096<p>ーーーーーーーーーーーー</p>Details<p>Year: 12</p><p>Subject: English</p><p>Category: Structure and Written Expression</p><p>Sub-category: Passive Voice; Causative Construction</p><p>Code: 12.5</p><p>Keywords: change into passive, causative have, causative get, passive causative</p><br />
