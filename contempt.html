Giving up finally, he looked up in contempt and said as he walked away,”those grapes surely must be sour. I wouldn’t eat them even if they were served to me on a golden dish” it is easy to despite what you cannot have

                                            Every part of this earth is sacred to my people. Every shining pine needle, every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every humming insect is holy in the memory and experience of my people. The perfumed flowers are our sisters; the deer, the horse, the great eagle, these are our brothers. The rocky crests, the juices in the meadows, the body heat of pony, and man - all belong to the same family. So when the Great Chief in Washington sends word that wishes to buy our land, he asks much of us. I do not know. Our ways are different from your ways. The sight of your cities pains the eyes. There is no quiet place in the cities. No place to hear the unfurling of leaves in the spring or the rustle of insects' wings. I have seen a thousand buffaloes rotting on the prairie, left by the men who shot them from a passing train. What is man without the beasts? If all the beasts were gone, men would die from a great loneliness of spirit. For whatever happens to the beast, soon happens to man. All. things are connected. The rivers are our brothers, they quench our thirst. The rivers carry our canoes, and feed our children. If we sell you our land, you must remember, and teach your children, that the rivers are our brothers, and yours, and you must henceforth give rivers the kindness you would give any brother. The air is precious for all things share the same breath the beast, the tree, the man, they all share the same breath. If we sell you our land, you must remember that the air is precious to us, that the air shares its spirit with all the life it supports. And if we sell you our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where even the White Man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow's flowers. The White Man must treat the beasts of this land as his brothers. Teach your children what we have taught our children, that the earth is our mother. Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons of the earth. If men spit upon the ground, they spit upon themselves. This we know. The earth does not belong to man; man belongs to earth. All things are connected like the blood which unites one family. Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons of the earth. Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself. One thing we know our God is the same God. He is the God of man, and his compassion is equal for the red man and the white. This earth is precious to Him, and to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its Creator. Continue to contaminate your bed, and you will one night suffocate in your own waste. So if we sell you our land, love it as we've loved it. Care for it as we've cared for it. Hold in your mind the memory of the land as it is when you take it. And with all your strength, with all your mind, with all your heart, preserve it for your children, and love it as God loves us all. (Adapted from "Our Sacred Land" by Chief Seattle, 1854, in English Form 5 by Yunus and Spykerman, 1991).1.What is Chief seattle’s attitude toward nature?2.Who was the ‘Great Chief’ reffred to in the passage? 3.Why did Chief Seattle stress the point that man and nature are inseparable?4.When Chief seattle made references to the beasts, the rivers and the air, what was he trying to emphasize in his argument? 5.When Chief Seattle made a reference to God in paragraph 10, what point was he attempting to highlight? 6.What were the main arguments Chief seattle put forward? ​</a>

One has to use logics and sometimes reference too to get the idea of them. Here are the explanation for each of them</p>The key to find the meaning of such proverb or expression is by paying attention to the synonym of it. The word 'treasure' indicates something precious. So, C is the best choice.Such expression means to aim high if the consequence is the same as aiming low. So, option A seems the most possible.Again pay attention to the details, 'company" here means friend who share the same feeling.The answer refers to the part of leopard, So, 'spots' is the most proper one.The answer refers to the opposite of poison, which is 'medicine'This proverb which means that you may lose your objective if you know the person too well or too close in investigating a case, only has one proper answer, that is 'breeds'.Necessity is like a condition, while mother is related to the beginning of something like a creation. So,the best option is C for the meaning.The meaning for such proverb is quite the same as the one in the previous number, the answer is E.It is a description of something on number 9, it seems to be a riddle for 'snow'.This is also a pun or funny riddle which means something not related to a room in the house. So, the answer is D.<p></p><p><strong>Pelajari lebih jauh:</strong></p><p>Materi tentang proverb</p><p>https://brainly.co.id/tugas/129566</p><p>https://brainly.co.id/tugas/6061652</p><p>Materi tentang riddle</p><p>https://brainly.co.id/tugas/10314005</p><p></p><p><strong>Detail jawaban:</strong></p><p>Kelas: SMA</p><p>Mapel: English</p><p>Kategori: proverb and riddle</p><p>Kode:</p><p>#AyoBelajar</p><br />

One sunny day, the fox woke up and saw the grapes glistening by the sunlight. The vineyard looked heavenly and the grapes looked so luscious that the famished fox could no longer control itself. He jumped to reach them but fell down.
He jumped again. Now, they were much higher. He jumped even more. But they were still out of reach.
He jumped and stretched and hopped but to no avail. Those yummy grapes hung higher than the fox could reach. No matter how hard he tried, the fox could not reach the grapes. He panted and began to sweat out of exhaustion.
Giving up finally, he looked up in contempt and said as he walked away,”those grapes surely must be sour. I wouldn’t eat them even if they were served to me on a golden dish” it is easy to despite what you cannot have

                            16. Many years ago I 1 __________to spend New Year's Eve with my family. I didn’t normally spent new year with my parents but I had nowhere to go, and being with my family seemed preferable to being on my own.
When my parents 2 __________the door I could see they were smiling and that they were genuinely happy to see me. I 3 __________addicted to heroin for 10 years, and for them, seeing me was the confirmation that I wasn't dead in an alley. Unfortunately, I had nothing new or exciting to tell them, just the same sad old stories. I 4 __________from crappy job to crappy job, being invariably sacked, and I had been resorting to crime whenever I was out of money. Same old, same old.
During dinner, I 5 __________a few glassfuls of whisky. I needed something to make ease the pain, because for the whole evening my sisters 6 __________at me with such contempt that it was unbearable. My own sisters hated me. Then I had a moment of realization; I 7 __________that they would never hate me as much as I hated myself.
When we finished dinner I raised my glass. "I'm going into rehab," I said. My parents 8 __________at me with some kind of hope. Parents never lose hope. But my sisters just looked down with disdain. They 9 __________perfectly well that I had been in rehab centers many times before, and that this time wouldn't be different.

                            29. Every part of this earth is sacred to my people. Every shining pine needle, every sandy shore, every mist in the dark woods, every humming insect is holy in the memory and experience of my people. The perfumed flowers are our sisters; the deer, the horse, the great eagle, these are our brothers. The rocky crests, the juices in the meadows, the body heat of pony, and man - all belong to the same family. So when the Great Chief in Washington sends word that wishes to buy our land, he asks much of us. I do not know. Our ways are different from your ways. The sight of your cities pains the eyes. There is no quiet place in the cities. No place to hear the unfurling of leaves in the spring or the rustle of insects' wings. I have seen a thousand buffaloes rotting on the prairie, left by the men who shot them from a passing train. What is man without the beasts? If all the beasts were gone, men would die from a great loneliness of spirit. For whatever happens to the beast, soon happens to man. All. things are connected. The rivers are our brothers, they quench our thirst. The rivers carry our canoes, and feed our children. If we sell you our land, you must remember, and teach your children, that the rivers are our brothers, and yours, and you must henceforth give rivers the kindness you would give any brother. The air is precious for all things share the same breath the beast, the tree, the man, they all share the same breath. If we sell you our land, you must remember that the air is precious to us, that the air shares its spirit with all the life it supports. And if we sell you our land, you must keep it apart and sacred, as a place where even the White Man can go to taste the wind that is sweetened by the meadow's flowers. The White Man must treat the beasts of this land as his brothers. Teach your children what we have taught our children, that the earth is our mother. Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons of the earth. If men spit upon the ground, they spit upon themselves. This we know. The earth does not belong to man; man belongs to earth. All things are connected like the blood which unites one family. Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons of the earth. Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. Whatever he does to the web, he does to himself. One thing we know our God is the same God. He is the God of man, and his compassion is equal for the red man and the white. This earth is precious to Him, and to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its Creator. Continue to contaminate your bed, and you will one night suffocate in your own waste. So if we sell you our land, love it as we've loved it. Care for it as we've cared for it. Hold in your mind the memory of the land as it is when you take it. And with all your strength, with all your mind, with all your heart, preserve it for your children, and love it as God loves us all. (Adapted from "Our Sacred Land" by Chief Seattle, 1854, in English Form 5 by Yunus and Spykerman, 1991).1.What is Chief seattle’s attitude toward nature?2.Who was the ‘Great Chief’ reffred to in the passage? 3.Why did Chief Seattle stress the point that man and nature are inseparable?4.When Chief seattle made references to the beasts, the rivers and the air, what was he trying to emphasize in his argument? 5.When Chief Seattle made a reference to God in paragraph 10, what point was he attempting to highlight? 6.What were the main arguments Chief seattle put forward? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answers:</strong></p><p><strong>1.</strong> He loves the nature with all his heart.</p><p><strong>2.</strong> "The Great Chief in Washington" in this passage refers to President George Washington.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> - Because he believed that earth doesn't belong to men, but the other way round. </p><p>- He believed that all good or harm that men does to earth will impact men one way or the other. (..Whatever befalls the earth, befalls the sons of the earth...)</p><p></p><p><strong>4.</strong> He's trying to emphasize that if their land were to be bought, the Americans (though native Indians are technically the actual native Americans,  I will refer to "white" Americans as Americans.) will have to preserve, nurture and love every part of the nature with every part of their body, strength and mind. </p><p></p><p><strong>5.</strong> That God loves everyone equally, regarding of their race, and that God believes that all men must take care of the earth. Whoever commits harm against nature will heap contempt on its creator. </p><p></p><p><strong>6</strong>. Chief Seattle's Arguments</p>What their land and their nature meant to him, his tribe and his ancestors.As someone who lived alongside nature all his life, he believed that the Americans were bad at preserving harmony with nature, as apparent with their cities and what they had done to wild beasts.If the Americans did manage to purchase their land, they must promise to protect and preserve it with all their heart and strength, and he warned them about the consequences that may befall them if they broke this  promise. <p></p><p>Ngerjakannya seru banget, and I hope this helps!</p><p>Semangat belajar bahasa Inggrisnya!</p><p>Gambar dari Chief Seattle:</p><br />
